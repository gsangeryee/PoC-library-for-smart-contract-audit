# Smart Contract Audit PoC Library

This repository is a curated collection of **reproducible Proof-of-Concept (PoC) test cases** for smart contract vulnerabilities, written in Foundry using `forge`. It is designed as a companion to a structured auditing vault, enabling researchers and auditors to:

- Study real-world vulnerability patterns.
- Reuse testing techniques across audits.
- Reproduce attacks in a controlled environment.

## Usage

### Prerequisties

- Foundry
- Solc-compatible environment

### Run a PoC

```bash
cd token-bridge
forge install
forge build
forge test

```
